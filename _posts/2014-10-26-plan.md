# Plan

First, I will take part in GSOC next year and contribute my code to open sourse project Wine for a long term. When I success, I will takes an ielts exam and try to pass it over 6.5 point.
Moreover, I will try to write a book about Ubuntu, which an editor had contracted with me.
 Finally, when I am about to graduate, I will apply for  [Erasmus Mundus Master](http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/erasmus_mundus/index_en.php), which means I will study in Europe.
   [Erasmus Mundus Master](http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/erasmus_mundus/index_en.php) has a rich scholarship, which attracts  me  very much. Moreover, I am  desired to study abroad and see more things.
